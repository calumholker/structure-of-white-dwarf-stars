## Abstract
We formulate a model for the structure of a white dwarf star under various initial assumptions, both with and without relativistic effects. The model is solved using a computational Runge-Kutta method. Both models agree that as you increase the distance from the centre of the star, the mass increases and density decreases, as expected. When plotting over a range of central densities the results conclude that as mass increases, density increases. In the relativistic model there is a maximum mass, known as the Chandrasekhar mass. A value of Mc = 1.42MâŠ™ is calculated, which is in agreement with accepted values, within a margin of error induced by the assumptions taken in the model.
